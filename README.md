# Task Manager

This is divided into 2 different apps:

- the Frontend server, using Next.js for routing and server-side rendering
- The API server, which uses Strapi as a headless CMS

## Developing locally

to develop locally you must first install dependencies and then run an npm script to start the development servers. For this you need to run the following on both folders:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
